"""visualization package. Contains all code needed for results 
visualization over the different prefix and suffix lengths for the event 
logs used in this experiment. The code also allows for the inclusion of 
an automatic  'Case-Length De-Noising' step prior to visualization, as 
performed in the paper. 

The needed functionality is contained within the 
`pref_suf_plots_functionality.py` module. 

The `pref_suf_plots_utils.py` module contains the helper functions called 
upon by the main functionality.
